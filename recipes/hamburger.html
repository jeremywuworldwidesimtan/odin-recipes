        <h2>Ingredients (for one serving)</h2>
        <ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>(optional)</em> Season the ground meat with spices and herbs if you want to, then mix with the ground meat. <strong>You have to do this first.</strong></li>
            <li>Shape the ground meat into a flat, patty shape - using your hand.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can also buy ground meat that are already shaped into a patty.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Pre heat the pan and add your preferred type of oil.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Alternately, you can also use a grill.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Cook the patty for 4 to 5 minutes on one side, then flip and cook the other side for the same amount of time.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Depending on the size of the patty, you may need more or less than 4-5 minutes to fully cook your patty.</li>
                    <li>To ensure that your patty is fully cooked, cut open and make sure that the insides are also fully cooked.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Let the patty cool for a few minutes.</li> 
            <li>Put the patty alongside all of the vegetables and condiments on top of the bun base.</li> 
            <li><em>(optional)</em> Add cheese to turn the hamburger into a cheeseburger.</li> 
            <li>Cover the hamburger with the bun top.</li> 
        </ol>

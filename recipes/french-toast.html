        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>French toast</strong> is a breakfast bread that is made by cooking bread that has been soaked in an egg batter. It can be served with toppings or as part of a breakfast set with other foods.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>One quarter cup or 60 ml (2 oz) of milk or cream</li>
            <li>Slices of bread</li>
            <li>Butter or cooking oil</li>
            <li><em>(optional)</em> Flavorings such as vanilla extract or herbs</li>
            <li><em>(optional)</em> Toppings such as berries, jam, honey, butter or maple syrup</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the eggs with milk with a whisk. <em>(Optional)</em> Mix the flavorings.</li>
            <li>Preheat a pan at low heat, then add butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Soak a slice of bread in the egg batter and let it fry on the pan.</li>
            <li>Flip the bread after 30 seconds or when the bread is fried browned. Make sure that all of the bread is fully cooked, especially it's center.</li>
            <li>Take the bread out of the pan and serve it. <em>(Optional)</em> Add toppings.</li>
            <li>Repeat the above process. <strong>To speed up the process, simultaneously fry multiple soaked breads, fry as many as the pan can fit at the same time.</strong></li>
        </ol>
